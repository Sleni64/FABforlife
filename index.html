         7/10 for B Street – Good Vibes, Some Room to Grow
B Street gets a respectable 7 out of 10 from me. The vibes are great—always lively, solid music, and it’s a fun spot to go with friends whether you're grabbing a bite or just hanging out.
The food? Honestly, pretty good. Some items hit harder than others, but overall it’s satisfying. The fries and sandwiches are usually a win, and the drink selection holds its own. Service is friendly, though it can be a little hit or miss depending on how busy it is.
What’s keeping it from being higher? Just a few small things—maybe a little more consistency in the food, maybe a stronger signature item that really makes B Street pop. But it’s still a place I’d recommend and come back to.
Reliable, chill, and a good time. B Street is doing its thing.

         💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Aca Taco – Chico's Flavor King
If I could give Aca Taco 10 Big Booms, I would without hesitation. This place delivers every single time. Whether you're rolling through for a quick burrito, diving into a giant plate of nachos, or living your best life with some tacos on the patio, it's always fire. 🌮🔥
The portions? Massive. The flavor? Chef’s kiss. And the salsa bar? A gift to humanity. It's the kind of place that makes you forget you're a college student running on fumes and caffeine—until you’re in a food coma, and it’s worth every bite.
Service is chill, food comes out quick, and the vibe is very “post-class treat yourself” energy. A Chico classic.

         💥💥💥💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Celestino’s – Good Slice, But Not My Ride-or-Die
Celestino’s gets 6 Big Booms from me. It’s solid. It’s reliable. But it’s not blowing my mind.
The pizza slices are big, greasy in the best way, and hit the spot especially after a long day (or night 👀). The crust is decent, toppings are fine, and they don’t skimp on the cheese. But it can be inconsistent—some days the slice is fire, other days it's kinda meh and lukewarm.
The vibe is very grab-and-go, and the staff gets you in and out quick. Great for a late-night craving or casual bite, but not necessarily where I’d go for a top-tier pizza experience.
If you’re in the mood for New York-style and don’t feel like waiting, Celestino’s will do the job—but it’s not a full 10-Boom flavor explosion.

         9/10 Big Booms for Woodstock Pizza – A Slice Above the Rest
Woodstock Pizza deserves a solid 9 out of 10 Big Booms—and for good reason! From the moment you take your first bite, you can tell this pizza is crafted with care and serious flavor.
The crust strikes that perfect balance: crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. The toppings are fresh and generously layered, and the cheese melts just right without being greasy. Whether you’re into classic combos or their specialty pies, Woodstock consistently delivers.
The vibe is casual and welcoming, great for hanging out with friends or grabbing a quick, delicious meal. Service is friendly and efficient, which just adds to the overall great experience.
If you’re craving a quality pizza that feels homemade but better, Woodstock is your go-to. Just one point shy of perfection — mainly because I can never decide which amazing slice to pick!

          ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 8/10 Big Booms for Project Tea – Almost Perfect!
          Project Tea in Chico is a go-to spot for a refreshing drink and a fun snack. The vibe is super chill, the
          drinks are creative and tasty (big fan of the boba options!), and the service is usually friendly and quick.
          They’ve earned 8 Big Booms from me 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥—because they almost have it all. The only thing holding
          them back from a perfect 10 is consistency with the Korean corn dogs. Sometimes they hit just right—crispy,
          cheesy, golden perfection—and other times, they’re a little underwhelming or not available at all.
          If they can tighten up the corn dog game, this place would be a 10/10 no question. Still, highly recommend
          stopping by when you’re in the area!

          💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Mondo’s Coffee – Pure Chico Magic
          Mondo’s Coffee? 10 BIG BOOMS, no question.
          This place is everything a coffee shop should be—cozy, welcoming, and packed with heart. The coffee is
          consistently top-tier (shoutout to the cold brew), and the bagel breakfast sandwiches? Unreal. Jalapeño
          cheddar, loaded eggy goodness, melty cheese—it’s the breakfast hug you didn’t know you needed.
          But what really sets Mondo’s apart is the vibe. It's not just about coffee—it's about community. Everyone is
          friendly, the space feels like a second home, and the mission behind it (supporting people with developmental
          disabilities) makes supporting them feel even better.
          Whether you're pulling up to study, hang with a friend, or just grab a quick bite, Mondo’s always delivers.
          10/10 Big Booms. Mondo’s is the moment. 💥

If I could give Dutch Bros TEN big booms, I would—because that’s exactly how much I love this place! From the moment you pull up, the energy is high, the vibes are immaculate, and the baristas treat you like you’re their best friend. They don’t just make coffee—they serve up sunshine in a cup.
Every drink is a hit. Whether it’s a Rebel, a freeze, or a classic iced kicker, it always tastes like it was made with extra love. And let’s talk about speed—even with a long line, they keep things moving without sacrificing quality.
Plus, the customizations? Endless. Want it sweet, strong, blended, iced, with a splash of something extra? They’ve got you. And they’ll do it with a smile and a chat that makes your day better.
Dutch Bros, you’ve officially earned 10 BIG BOOMS from me. 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
 Keep being awesome.

           💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Starbucks – Basic Brew Energy
Starbucks gets 3 Big Booms from me, and that’s mostly for being open and having bathrooms.
Let’s be real—if coffee had a corporate dress code, this would be it. The drinks are either watered down or loaded with sugar to the point you forget you ordered coffee. Every seasonal drink tastes like a candle, and somehow still costs $7. Cool.
Mobile order? Might as well send a message in a bottle. And if you’ve ever gotten a drink that actually looks like the menu photo, congrats—you’re the chosen one.
Starbucks is the place you go when you don’t feel like making decisions or when you’ve given up trying to find something better. It’s not terrible... but it’s not giving anything more than “default caffeine source.”

          The boba stop- Cozy, welcoming, grab & go
If you’re in Chico and craving something refreshing, flavorful, and just a little fun, The Boba Stop should definitely be on your radar. Nestled just a few minutes from the Chico State campus, this small but vibrant shop delivers big on taste, creativity, and charm. Whether you’re a boba enthusiast or just looking for a sweet afternoon pick-me-up, this spot checks all the boxes.
The drink menu at The Boba Stop is surprisingly diverse for such a small shop, offering everything from traditional milk teas to inventive snow bubbles and matcha blends. I started off with their Tiger Milk Tea, which features creamy milk tea layered with rich brown sugar syrup and chewy, fresh boba pearls. It’s sweet—but not overpoweringly so—with a smooth black tea base that brings balance. It’s the kind of drink that reminds you why boba took off in the first place.
One of their everyday customers, Hanzel gave this boba spot a whopping 10/10 stars!!
