          ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 8/10 Big Booms for Project Tea – Almost Perfect!
          Project Tea in Chico is a go-to spot for a refreshing drink and a fun snack. The vibe is super chill, the
          drinks are creative and tasty (big fan of the boba options!), and the service is usually friendly and quick.
          They’ve earned 8 Big Booms from me 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥—because they almost have it all. The only thing holding
          them back from a perfect 10 is consistency with the Korean corn dogs. Sometimes they hit just right—crispy,
          cheesy, golden perfection—and other times, they’re a little underwhelming or not available at all.
          If they can tighten up the corn dog game, this place would be a 10/10 no question. Still, highly recommend
          stopping by when you’re in the area!

          💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Mondo’s Coffee – Pure Chico Magic
          Mondo’s Coffee? 10 BIG BOOMS, no question.
          This place is everything a coffee shop should be—cozy, welcoming, and packed with heart. The coffee is
          consistently top-tier (shoutout to the cold brew), and the bagel breakfast sandwiches? Unreal. Jalapeño
          cheddar, loaded eggy goodness, melty cheese—it’s the breakfast hug you didn’t know you needed.
          But what really sets Mondo’s apart is the vibe. It's not just about coffee—it's about community. Everyone is
          friendly, the space feels like a second home, and the mission behind it (supporting people with developmental
          disabilities) makes supporting them feel even better.
          Whether you're pulling up to study, hang with a friend, or just grab a quick bite, Mondo’s always delivers.
          10/10 Big Booms. Mondo’s is the moment. 💥

            ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10 Big Booms for Dutch Bros!
If I could give Dutch Bros TEN big booms, I would—because that’s exactly how much I love this place! From the moment you pull up, the energy is high, the vibes are immaculate, and the baristas treat you like you’re their best friend. They don’t just make coffee—they serve up sunshine in a cup.
Every drink is a hit. Whether it’s a Rebel, a freeze, or a classic iced kicker, it always tastes like it was made with extra love. And let’s talk about speed—even with a long line, they keep things moving without sacrificing quality.
Plus, the customizations? Endless. Want it sweet, strong, blended, iced, with a splash of something extra? They’ve got you. And they’ll do it with a smile and a chat that makes your day better.
Dutch Bros, you’ve officially earned 10 BIG BOOMS from me. 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
 Keep being awesome.

           💥💥💥 / 10 Big Booms for Starbucks – Basic Brew Energy
Starbucks gets 3 Big Booms from me, and that’s mostly for being open and having bathrooms.
Let’s be real—if coffee had a corporate dress code, this would be it. The drinks are either watered down or loaded with sugar to the point you forget you ordered coffee. Every seasonal drink tastes like a candle, and somehow still costs $7. Cool.
Mobile order? Might as well send a message in a bottle. And if you’ve ever gotten a drink that actually looks like the menu photo, congrats—you’re the chosen one.
Starbucks is the place you go when you don’t feel like making decisions or when you’ve given up trying to find something better. It’s not terrible... but it’s not giving anything more than “default caffeine source.”

          The boba stop- Cozy, welcoming, grab & go
If you’re in Chico and craving something refreshing, flavorful, and just a little fun, The Boba Stop should definitely be on your radar. Nestled just a few minutes from the Chico State campus, this small but vibrant shop delivers big on taste, creativity, and charm. Whether you’re a boba enthusiast or just looking for a sweet afternoon pick-me-up, this spot checks all the boxes.
The drink menu at The Boba Stop is surprisingly diverse for such a small shop, offering everything from traditional milk teas to inventive snow bubbles and matcha blends. I started off with their Tiger Milk Tea, which features creamy milk tea layered with rich brown sugar syrup and chewy, fresh boba pearls. It’s sweet—but not overpoweringly so—with a smooth black tea base that brings balance. It’s the kind of drink that reminds you why boba took off in the first place.
One of their everyday customers, Hanzel gave this boba spot a whopping 10/10 stars!!
