          7/10 for B Street – Good Vibes, Some Room to Grow
          B Street gets a respectable 7 out of 10 from me. The vibes are great—always lively, solid music, and it’s a
          fun spot to go with friends whether you're grabbing a bite or just hanging out.
          The food? Honestly, pretty good. Some items hit harder than others, but overall it’s satisfying. The fries
          and
          sandwiches are usually a win, and the drink selection holds its own. Service is friendly, though it can be a
          little hit or miss depending on how busy it is.
          What’s keeping it from being higher? Just a few small things—maybe a little more consistency in the food,
          maybe a stronger signature item that really makes B Street pop. But it’s still a place I’d recommend and
          come
          back to.
          Reliable, chill, and a good time. B Street is doing its thing.

          10 Big Booms for Aca Taco – Chico's Flavor King
          If I could give Aca Taco 10 Big Booms, I would without hesitation. This place delivers every single time.
          Whether you're rolling through for a quick burrito, diving into a giant plate of nachos, or living your best
          life with some tacos on the patio, it's always fire. 🌮🔥
          The portions? Massive. The flavor? Chef’s kiss. And the salsa bar? A gift to humanity. It's the kind of place
          that makes you forget you're a college student running on fumes and caffeine—until you’re in a food coma, and
          it’s worth every bite.
          Service is chill, food comes out quick, and the vibe is very “post-class treat yourself” energy. A Chico
          classic.

          10 Big Booms for Celestino’s – Good Slice, But Not My Ride-or-Die
          Celestino’s gets 6 Big Booms from me. It’s solid. It’s reliable. But it’s not blowing my mind.
          The pizza slices are big, greasy in the best way, and hit the spot especially after a long day (or night
          👀).
          The crust is decent, toppings are fine, and they don’t skimp on the cheese. But it can be
          inconsistent—some
          days the slice is fire, other days it's kinda meh and lukewarm.
          The vibe is very grab-and-go, and the staff gets you in and out quick. Great for a late-night craving or
          casual bite, but not necessarily where I’d go for a top-tier pizza experience.
          If you’re in the mood for New York-style and don’t feel like waiting, Celestino’s will do the job—but it’s
          not
          a full 10-Boom flavor explosion.

                Chico’s hidden gem for craft beer.
                If you’re searching for a place in Chico that blends the quality of a craft beer bar with the
                comfort and
                heart of a local eatery, The Lost Dutchman Taproom is it. It may have “taproom” in the name, but
                don’t let
                that fool you—this is just as much a full-on restaurant as it is a beer spot, and it delivers a
                full dining
                experience that feels thoughtful, satisfying, and welcoming from start to finish.
                One of the top customers (Hector) of this restaurant has been giving this spot a 10/10 for years,
                he said
                since he first went there, the vibes and food were immaculate and could never stop going back
                since!

                9/10 Big Booms for Woodstock Pizza – A Slice Above the Rest
                Woodstock Pizza deserves a solid 9 out of 10 Big Booms—and for good reason! From the moment
                you take your
                first bite, you can tell this pizza is crafted with care and serious flavor.
                The crust strikes that perfect balance: crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. The
                toppings are fresh
                and generously layered, and the cheese melts just right without being greasy. Whether you’re
                into classic
                combos or their specialty pies, Woodstock consistently delivers.
                The vibe is casual and welcoming, great for hanging out with friends or grabbing a quick,
                delicious meal.
                Service is friendly and efficient, which just adds to the overall great experience.
                If you’re craving a quality pizza that feels homemade but better, Woodstock is your go-to.
                Just one point shy
                of perfection — mainly because I can never decide which amazing slice to pick!

              Big Booms for Project Tea – Almost Perfect!
              Project Tea in Chico is a go-to spot for a refreshing drink and a fun snack. The vibe
              is super chill, the
              drinks are creative and tasty (big fan of the boba options!), and the service is
              usually friendly and quick.
              They’ve earned 8 Big Booms from me 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥—because they almost have it all.
              The only thing holding
              them back from a perfect 10 is consistency with the Korean corn dogs. Sometimes they
              hit just right—crispy,
              cheesy, golden perfection—and other times, they’re a little underwhelming or not
              available at all.
              If they can tighten up the corn dog game, this place would be a 10/10 no question.
              Still, highly recommend
              stopping by when you’re in the area!

              10 Big Booms for Mondo’s Coffee – Pure Chico Magic
              Mondo’s Coffee? 10 BIG BOOMS, no question.
              This place is everything a coffee shop should be—cozy, welcoming, and packed with
              heart. The coffee is
              consistently top-tier (shoutout to the cold brew), and the bagel breakfast sandwiches?
              Unreal. Jalapeño
              cheddar, loaded eggy goodness, melty cheese—it’s the breakfast hug you didn’t know you
              needed.
              But what really sets Mondo’s apart is the vibe. It's not just about coffee—it's about
              community. Everyone is
              friendly, the space feels like a second home, and the mission behind it (supporting
              people with developmental
              disabilities) makes supporting them feel even better.
              Whether you're pulling up to study, hang with a friend, or just grab a quick bite,
              Mondo’s always delivers.
              10/10 Big Booms. Mondo’s is the moment. 💥

              If I could give Dutch Bros TEN big booms, I would—because that’s exactly how much I
              love this place! From the
              moment you pull up, the energy is high, the vibes are immaculate, and the baristas
              treat you like you’re their
              best friend. They don’t just make coffee—they serve up sunshine in a cup.
              Every drink is a hit. Whether it’s a Rebel, a freeze, or a classic iced kicker, it
              always tastes like it was
              made with extra love. And let’s talk about speed—even with a long line, they keep
              things moving without
              sacrificing quality.
              Plus, the customizations? Endless. Want it sweet, strong, blended, iced, with a splash
              of something extra?
              They’ve got you. And they’ll do it with a smile and a chat that makes your day better.
              Dutch Bros, you’ve officially earned 10 BIG BOOMS from me. 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
              Keep being awesome.

              10 Big Booms for Starbucks – Basic Brew Energy
              Starbucks gets 3 Big Booms from me, and that’s mostly for being open and having
              bathrooms.
              Let’s be real—if coffee had a corporate dress code, this would be it. The drinks are
              either watered down or
              loaded with sugar to the point you forget you ordered coffee. Every seasonal drink
              tastes like a candle, and
              somehow still costs $7. Cool.
              Mobile order? Might as well send a message in a bottle. And if you’ve ever gotten a
              drink that actually looks
              like the menu photo, congrats—you’re the chosen one.
              Starbucks is the place you go when you don’t feel like making decisions or when you’ve
              given up trying to find
              something better. It’s not terrible... but it’s not giving anything more than “default
              caffeine source.”

              The boba stop- Cozy, welcoming, grab & go
              If you’re in Chico and craving something refreshing, flavorful, and just a little fun,
              The Boba Stop should
              definitely be on your radar. Nestled just a few minutes from the Chico State campus,
              this small but vibrant
              shop delivers big on taste, creativity, and charm. Whether you’re a boba enthusiast or
              just looking for a
              sweet afternoon pick-me-up, this spot checks all the boxes.
              The drink menu at The Boba Stop is surprisingly diverse for such a small shop,
              offering everything from
              traditional milk teas to inventive snow bubbles and matcha blends. I started off with
              their Tiger Milk Tea,
              which features creamy milk tea layered with rich brown sugar syrup and chewy, fresh
              boba pearls. It’s
              sweet—but not overpoweringly so—with a smooth black tea base that brings balance. It’s
              the kind of drink that
              reminds you why boba took off in the first place.
              One of their everyday customers, Hanzel gave this boba spot a whopping 10/10 stars!!

              Wingstop – Finger-Lickin’ Good, But Not Perfect
              Wingstop definitely knows how to satisfy a wing craving. The wings come out
              hot, crispy, and tossed in a
              variety
              of bold sauces that pack a punch—whether you’re all about the classic Original
              Hot or want to try something
              sweeter like Honey BBQ.
              The flavors are consistently tasty, and the portions are generous, making it
              great for sharing with friends or
              just treating yourself. The sides, especially the seasoned fries, are a nice
              bonus that round out the meal.
              That said, sometimes the service can be hit or miss, and depending on the
              location, wait times might get a bit
              long during busy hours.
              Overall, Wingstop is a reliable spot for solid wings and bold
              flavors—definitely earns some Big Booms from me!

              Panda Express – Fast, Familiar, and Comfortingly Predictable
              Panda Express is the classic go-to for quick Chinese-American
              food that’s consistent and convenient. Their
              dishes are flavorful, though they lean more on the sweet and
              savory side than authentic. Favorites like Orange
              Chicken and Beijing Beef are crowd-pleasers and deliver that
              addictive balance of crispy, saucy, and
              satisfying.
              The portion sizes are generous, and the service is usually
              fast, making it perfect for a quick lunch or dinner
              when you want something warm and filling without the wait.
              While it’s not the place for a truly authentic Chinese meal,
              Panda Express hits the spot when you’re craving
              bold flavors and easy comfort food.
